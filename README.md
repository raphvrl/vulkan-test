# vulkan-test

This project is solely a test for Vulkan, serving as a learning foundation that could potentially lead to the development of a complete lib.

## Objectives

- Learn Vulkan 1.3 features:
    - Bindless descriptors
    - Dynamic rendering
- Explore framebuffer usage for post-processing
- Implement a more efficient ECS (Entity Component System)
- Restructure the Vulkan architecture to avoid monolithic classes and improve separation of concerns

This repository remains a temporary learning and experimentation project.
